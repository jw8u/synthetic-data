# Testing approaches to generating synthetic data

A major problem surrounding the release of datasets of experimental studies is how to maintain the privacy of the respondents. The corresponding risk of identity disclosure drastically limits sharing of scientific data. An increasingly plausible solution to reducing identity disclosure risk is to generate synthetic datasets, that is, datasets that are generated artificially to replace some sample data. In this project, CART and parametric methods of generating synthetic data are compared on a chosen dataset by calculating disclosure risks and data utility measures.
For the full methodology and results, please see *Report.pdf*. Here, the overall quality and usefulness of the synthetic datasets with respect to the original data is discussed. In addition, the measures will be generated on differing number of synthetic datasets, and the results will be compared.
The functions that were created are in *functions.R* Please note that some of the functions depend on some other functions that are not included here so it won't be possible to run some of the functions.
