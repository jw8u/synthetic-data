# Testing approaches to generating synthetic data

In this project, CART and parametric methods of generating
synthetic data are compared on a chosen dataset by calculating disclosure
risks and data utility measures. 
The many functions that were created are in functions.R
The final report (.pdf and .tex files) explains the approaches taken and the results.
